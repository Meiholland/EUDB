# Investor Research Guidelines

## Summary of Research Requirements

### Core Principle
**Do not provide generic text. Research each firm individually to find out what they actually do.**

### Research Process

1. **Individual Firm Research**
   - Research each investor firm individually
   - Find their actual website (often the first Google result)
   - Read their website, portfolio, and about pages
   - Understand their specific focus, investment strategy, and portfolio companies

2. **Quality Standards**
   - **No generic descriptions**: Avoid template-like descriptions that could apply to any VC firm
   - **Specific details**: Include actual portfolio companies, investment amounts, fund sizes, and unique characteristics
   - **Accurate websites**: Find and verify the actual website URL for each firm
   - **Real information**: Base descriptions on actual research, not assumptions

3. **Example of Good Research**
   - **Sofia Angels Ventures**: 
     - Found website: sofiaventures.eu (first Google result)
     - Specific details: "€13 million venture capital fund backed by the European Investment Fund to co-invest alongside angels, family offices and other private investors and funds"
     - Investment focus: "pre-seed & seed stage predominantly from Bulgaria, SEE & CEE countries"
     - Management: "angel investors, entrepreneurs and executives that turned VCs"
     - Portfolio examples: Ogre AI, AgroHub, Fabrico.io, Jobio
     - Investment range: "€200,000 to €500,000 initial, up to €1 million follow-on"

4. **What to Include in Descriptions**
   - Fund size (if available)
   - Investment stage focus (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.)
   - Geographic focus
   - Sector focus (be specific)
   - Notable portfolio companies
   - Investment size ranges
   - Unique characteristics or differentiators
   - Management team background (if relevant and available)

5. **What NOT to Do**
   - Don't use generic phrases like "supports innovative startups building scalable businesses"
   - Don't assume all VCs do the same thing
   - Don't skip research and fill in with template text
   - Don't guess website URLs

### Research Script Pattern

When creating research scripts (e.g., `research_bulgaria.py`):

1. Research each investor individually
2. Find their actual website
3. Write specific, researched descriptions
4. Include real portfolio companies and details
5. Update existing descriptions with full paragraphs (not just add to them)

### Current Status

- **Completed**: Sofia Ventures (Bulgaria) - properly researched with accurate details
- **In Progress**: Other Bulgarian investors need individual research
- **Pattern**: Apply this research approach to all countries (Norway, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, etc.)

### Key Takeaway

**One quick search on Google would reveal the actual website and specific information about each firm. Always do that search rather than providing generic descriptions.**
